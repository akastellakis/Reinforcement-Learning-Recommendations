# Reinforcement Learning Recommendations

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Recommendations repository! 
This project demonstrates the implementation of a recommendation system using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. The self-explanatory Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides a detailed guide on how to build a recommendation system using RL techniques,
such as Policy Iteration and Q-learning. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in various industries, from e-commerce to content streaming platforms. This project aims to showcase the application of RL algorithms in developing a powerful recommendation engine. 
Reinforcement Learning allows the system to learn from user interactions and improve recommendations over time.

## Usage

Open and explore the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. It contains a self-explanatory guide and code examples to help you understand the implementation of the RL-based recommendation system.
